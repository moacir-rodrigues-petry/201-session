### Overview

This repo is split in a backend application and a frontend application. The backend is an Express.js API that serves user data, while the frontend is a React.js application that consumes this API and displays the data in a user-friendly format.

The **users-api** is a directory that contains the backend application, and the **users-frontend** is a directory that contains the frontend application.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The **users-api** and **users-frontend** directories do not exist yet. You will create these directories as you follow the steps outlined in the module instructions below.

### Requirements

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **TypeScript**: The backend and frontend applications are built using TypeScript.
- **Express.js**: The backend uses Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- **React.js**: The frontend is built using React.js.

#### Module 1 - create a backend API application

Atthach to the GitHub Copilot Agent Mode the following files to run this command below:

- `.github/instructions/root-path.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/backend-application.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/backend-structure.instructions.md`

`Create a backend API application using Express.js and TypeScript. Use the @faker-js/faker library to generate mock data and ts-node-dev to run the app. Implement a route at /api/users that responds with a JSON array of 10 fake users. Each user should have the following fields: id, name, username, email, and role. Organize the project using TypeScript best practices, including type definitions and modular structure. Use CORS middleware to allow requests from http://localhost:3001.`

##### Module 2 - create a frontend application

Atthach to the GitHub Copilot Agent Mode the following files to run this command below:

- `.github/instructions/root-path.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/frontend-application.instructions.md`

`Create a React.js frontend application using TypeScript that runs on port 3001 and fetches user data from http://localhost:3000/api/users. Define a User interface that reflects the backend data structure, and organize the project with a modular folder structure, including separate directories for components and types. Ensure the application includes proper error handling and loading states to deliver a smooth and reliable user experience. Use beautiful and modern CSS for styling to create a clean, responsive, and modern UI.`
