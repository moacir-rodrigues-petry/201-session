# Root path for this project

Root path for this project is `~/ModusCreate/201-v2-wip`.

Make sure to run all commands from the root directory of the project and add the entire path when executing commands that require a path or subdirectory.

Example: when using the terminal, run commands like this:

```bash
cd ~/ModusCreate/201-v2-wip/users-api && npm install
```

Instead of:

```bash
cd users-api && npm init -y
```

This incluces other commands like `mkdir`, and so on. This ensures that you are always in the correct context of the project, avoiding issues with relative paths and ensuring that all commands are executed in the right directory.
