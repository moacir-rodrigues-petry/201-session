# Backend Application - Express.js

- Create a directory called users-api and navigate into it. Initialize a new Node.js project with TypeScript and install the necessary dependencies.

- This backend API application uses the @faker-js/faker library to generate mock data and ts-node-dev to run the app.

- Use CORS middleware to allow requests from `http://localhost:3001`.

- Implement a route at /api/users that responds with a JSON array of 10 fake users.

- Each user should have the following fields: id, name, username, email, and role.

- Organize the project using TypeScript best practices, including type definitions and modular structure.

- Do not use the 'dist' folder in this project.
